              Hi. I'm Gary Shaw.
              <br />
              <br />I love all things software, gadgets, dogs üê∂ and my family
              ü•∞
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              This is my portfolio website where I'll be adding the projects I
              have worked on so far. It's a work in progress but feel free to
              look around üôÇ
              <br />
              <br />
              I completed the Northcoders full-stack software engineering
              bootcamp in January 2023 and prior to that I worked with
              enterprise software in pre-sales and post-sales.
              <br />
              <br />
              That has given me great experience across the whole software
              lifecycle from design & development through to sales,
              implementation & support.
              <br />
              <br />
              I'm looking for a role where I can combine my love of working with
              software and also helping people to use and benefit from it
              themselves.
              <br />
              <br />
              Feel free to get in touch using the links at the bottom of the
              page.
